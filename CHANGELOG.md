# Changelog

## [0.5.6] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **awareness-spec.json**: Added DO NOT record exclusion list (API keys, credentials, system bootstrap, sender metadata) to the single source of truth spec file.
- **CLAUDE.md alignment**: Added all 7 personal categories + DO NOT record list to STEP 4.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Record-rule prompt quality**: Added few-shot examples with correct/wrong annotations, explicit DO NOT SAVE exclusion list (greetings, metadata, news), organized categories into [Technical] and [Personal] groups.
- **Full 13-category alignment**: Added missing 5 personal categories (plan_intention, activity_preference, health_info, career_info, custom_misc) and skill category to record-rule prompt.
- **stripMarkdownPrefix regex**: Fixed `\w+` matching only first word in bold markers like `**Hacker News**`, changed to `[^*]+` for multi-word support.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Init perception injection**: `_buildInitPerception()` in mcp-handlers generates staleness + pitfall guard signals at session start (was empty array).
- **Keyword-context snippets**: search results show a window around the first matching term instead of always truncating from start.
- **Metadata hydration**: embedding-only search results now get title/type/tags/source from DB lookup.
- **Auto-title generation**: untitled results get a preview title from first content sentence.
- **Recall eval benchmark**: `recall-eval.mjs` with 20-query dataset, Recall@5=80%.

### Changed
- **RRF normalization**: scores normalized to 0-1 range with type-specific boost multipliers (knowledge_card=1.5x, decision=1.3x, turn_brief=0.4x).
- **CJK trigram threshold**: lowered from >4 to >=3 chars; short CJK terms (2-4 chars) also kept as-is for exact match.
- **Pattern detection**: tag co-occurrence (3+ in 7 days) replaces simple category count.
- **Staleness threshold**: unified to 30 days using COALESCE(updated_at, created_at).
- **Recall summary format**: now shows score%, days ago, ~tokens per result.
- **Perception messages**: English (was hardcoded Chinese).

### Fixed
- **session_checkpoint noise**: filtered from recall results by default (DEFAULT_TYPE_EXCLUDE).
- **Guard detector test**: mock now includes recentActiveCards for pattern signal generation.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Freshness from source timestamps**: `memory_profile_service.py` now derives profile freshness from the newest source card/risk timestamp instead of profile rebuild time, so stale knowledge stays marked stale after regeneration.
- **Concept-level recall anchors**: `query-planner.mjs` now expands paraphrase anchors by concept groups and intent-level anchors instead of tighter benchmark-phrase coupling, reducing overfit while keeping robust recall at full hit rate on the current fixture set.
- **Profile-gated repo guards**: repo-specific deployment guards now activate only for the Awareness repository profile; generic SDK usage no longer inherits Awareness-only docker/prisma deployment warnings by default.

### Fixed
- **Summary/object-view drift**: memory profile summaries now prefer rendered `Me / Goal / Context / Pattern` sections and avoid repeating lower-value legacy sections when object-view data is available.
- **Guard benchmark isolation**: perception benchmark and daemon perception now pass an explicit guard profile so repo-specific guard rules are tested and applied only when intended.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Robust multilingual recall benchmark**: Added `tests/memory-benchmark/datasets/universal_robust.jsonl` plus `benchmark:universal:robust` to measure paraphrase/noisy-query recall on the universal fixture corpus.

### Changed
- **Chinese paraphrase recall normalization**: `query-planner.mjs` now derives stronger anchor fallback queries for continuation, report-structure, and tool-decision prompts, improving recall on rewritten Chinese queries.

### Fixed
- **Robust benchmark misses resolved**: The three Chinese paraphrase misses in the robust universal benchmark are now resolved, bringing the builtin robust baseline to full recall/answer hit on the current 20-case dataset.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- **Major daemon refactor**: Extracted 1500+ lines from monolithic `daemon.mjs` into 12 focused modules under `daemon/` directory — constants, helpers, loaders, MCP contract/handlers, HTTP handlers, API handlers, tool bridge, cloud HTTP, file watcher, embedding helpers.
- **MCP server simplified**: `mcp-server.mjs` now delegates result building to `daemon/mcp-handlers.mjs`, reducing duplication between HTTP and stdio transports.
- **MCP stdio cleanup**: `mcp-stdio.mjs` uses shared enum constants and error helpers from `daemon/mcp-contract.mjs`.

### Added
- **Noise filter**: New `core/noise-filter.mjs` filters low-signal events (empty session checkpoints, terse untitled content) before storage, reducing memory clutter.
- **Knowledge card evolution**: Semantic dedup via embedding cosine similarity during card extraction — detects duplicates, updates, and contradictions.
- **Test suite**: 14 unit tests covering MCP contract, HTTP dispatch, noise filter, recall regressions, and embedding compatibility.

### Fixed
- **Port resolution bug**: `cmdStatus` and `cmdReindex` now correctly pass `projectDir` to `resolvePort()` for workspace registry lookup.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **CJK auto-detection + multilingual embedding lazy loading**: `detectNeedsCJK()` samples text for CJK character ratio (>5% threshold). When CJK content is detected, automatically loads `multilingual-e5-small` model on demand. English-only `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` remains the fast default.
- **Shared lang-detect module**: Extracted `detectNeedsCJK()` to `core/lang-detect.mjs` to avoid logic drift between daemon and search.
- **Model-aware vector search**: `search.mjs` now reads `model_id` from stored embeddings and matches each against the correct query vector — no more cross-model-space similarity comparisons.
- **Status endpoint enhancements**: `/status` now reports `multilingual_model` name and `auto_cjk_detection: true`.

### Changed
- `indexer.mjs`: `getAllEmbeddings()` now returns `model_id` field for each embedding.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **26-issue audit**: Data safety, dedup, i18n, and test fixes.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Source isolation and sourceExclude filtering**.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Content truncation removed**: Added 20k token budget, multi-project workspace isolation.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **healthz embedding diagnostics**: `/healthz` endpoint now includes `embedding` object with `available` boolean and `model` name, making it easier for desktop apps to display embedding status.

### Improved
- **Embedding warmup diagnostics**: When embedding model warmup fails, daemon now logs specific causes (network timeout, disk full, corrupted cache) and suggests fix commands (`rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/hub`). Previously only showed generic error message.
- **Warmup timing**: Logs exact warmup duration in seconds for performance monitoring.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Hybrid vector+FTS5 search (out of the box)**: SearchEngine now receives the embedder module, enabling dual-channel search (BM25 keyword + embedding cosine similarity) with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Previously only FTS5 was active despite the code being present.
- **Auto embedding on write**: Every new memory is automatically embedded and stored in SQLite on `awareness_record`, no manual step needed.
- **Startup model pre-warming**: Embedding model (~23MB, Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is downloaded and warmed up in the background on first daemon start. Subsequent starts use cached model.
- **Automatic embedding backfill**: On startup, memories without embeddings are backfilled in the background — existing users get vector search for all historical memories without any action.
- **healthz search_mode field**: `/healthz` endpoint now reports `search_mode: "hybrid"` or `"fts5-only"` so plugins can detect search capabilities.

### Changed
- **@huggingface/transformers promoted to required dependency**: Moved from `optionalDependencies` to `dependencies` to ensure vector search works out of the box via `npx`.
- **Shared embedder loading**: `_loadEmbedder()` is now a shared lazy-loader used by both SearchEngine and KnowledgeExtractor (was duplicated before).

## [0.3.12] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Knowledge card category fix (proper approach)**: Replaced hardcoded English alias map with proper fix at source — `awareness_record` MCP tool schema now explicitly enumerates all 13 valid categories in `describe()`. LLMs read the schema and output valid values directly. `normalizeCategory()` simplified to case/whitespace normalization + strict `VALID_CATEGORIES` lookup + fallback `key_point`. No language-specific aliases needed.

## [0.3.11] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Windows Chinese/CJK text rendering**: Force UTF-8 encoding on Windows for daemon process stdout/stderr and MCP stdio stdin/stdout/stderr — prevents Chinese characters from becoming "????" on Windows systems with non-UTF-8 code pages (e.g., CP936/GBK)

### Fixed (knowledge-extractor)
- **Non-standard knowledge card categories**: `processPreExtracted()` now normalizes LLM-generated categories via `normalizeCategory()`. Maps TROUBLESHOOTING → `problem_solution`, BEST-PRACTICE → `insight`, SETUP → `workflow`, etc. — no more unlisted categories appearing in the dashboard or being silently downgraded to `key_point` during cloud sync

## [0.3.10] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Initial CHANGELOG (backfilled from git history)
